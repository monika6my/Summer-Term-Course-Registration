# Academic Summer Session Processing

In the coursework of CSE-321 Software Engineering (SWE) course, we created the software design for summer term course registration of LNMIIT courses

This project is to facilitate students in registering for courses during the summer term to clear backlogs. The following steps were undertaken for software design:
1.  Systems Requirement Specification (SRS) by interviewing the stakeholders
2.  Analysis of the requirements of the software 
3.  Functional Point Analysis (FPA)
4.  Data Flow Diagram (DFD) level 0, level 1, and level 2
5.  Class diagrams
6.  Component diagrams
7.  Use Case Diagrams (UCDs)
8.  Use Case Activity Diagrams (UCADs)
9.  ERD and UML
10.  Sequence diagrams
11.  Test cases and also used APIs (of other modules, Gmail, Classroom)
We worked on layers of permissions and different functionalities were made available at different levels for different types of users
